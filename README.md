# js-native-api-test

Test suite for JavaScript Engine specific portion of Node-api.

This repository holds a copy of the js-native-api subset of the Node-api test suite so that
it can be used to validate native api implementations outside of Node.js.

Currently we are still working on the process to extract the test suite and publish it to this
repo on a regular basis.
